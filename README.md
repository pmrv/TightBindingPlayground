# TightBindingPlayground
Visualize simple tight-binding band structures. [Intro from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_binding)

Slides.nb contains plots and interactive graphics that show case some examples. Hopping.nb has less pictures, but explains how the code works and how to plot your own systems. I hope the explanations are understandable, but they do assume that you have some knowledge about the tight binding approximation. I also added .cdf files that you view with Wolfram's free [CDF Player](https://www.wolfram.com/cdf-player/) in case you don't have a Mathematica license.

## TODO

* add overlap sometimes leads to nonsensical results and I don't understand why yet
* I'd like to add a notebook on how to compute hopping integrals from, maybe, Slater or Gaussian type orbitals
* at some point I should add python or julia versions of the notebooks, because, you know, free software and all that
